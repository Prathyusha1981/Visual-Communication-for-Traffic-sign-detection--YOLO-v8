# Visual-Communication-for-Traffic-sign-detection--YOLO-v8
Traffic sign detection is a critical task for improving road safety and assisting autonomous vehicles. This project proposes a method for traffic sign detection that uses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.
The YOLOv8 algorithm is used to detect the location of traffic signs in an image, and image processing is used to recognize the type of traffic sign. The results of the project show that the proposed method can accurately detect and recognize traffic signs in real-world images and videos.
